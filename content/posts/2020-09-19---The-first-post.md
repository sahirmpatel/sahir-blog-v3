# The First Post



I've decided to start writing, not yet sure what kind of content I'm gonna put here though. It might vary from programming concepts, book reviews, weightlifting related content, interesting things I find online, or just pure ramblings related to day to day stuff. I guess we'll find out as we go, can't promise anything. 

Something i can promise though - 

 -  ***It'll be consistent***- this isn't a side project (which I usually
   discontinue working on after some weeks ðŸ˜­), I've seen people writing their blogs for years, even decades - I plan to do the same
 - ***It'll be interesting*** - I know how low our generation's attention span is - So I plan to keep the content short and concise (mostly)

Also, some posts will include a cool video, something I'm copying from [Haseeb's blog](https://haseebq.com/)

Right now the plan is to become a sponge, absorb everything , learn everything , scour the net , reach out to mentors - just gather as much information as possible. Which i then plan to put in here , hope you'll be around to read it. 

Here Goes,
